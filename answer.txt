What's Your Name? is the third studio album by Adam Sandler, released in 1997. Unlike his other comedy albums, which typically mix songs with non-musical comedy skits, What's Your Name? consists mostly of songs and only includes one skit. The songs are recorded in various genres, including country, hard rock, 2 Springsteen-influenced numbers, ballad and reggae, as well as the inclusion of "Red Hooded Sweatshirt", which Sandler originally performed on Saturday Night Live in 1993. What's Your Name? was certified gold, having sold over 500,000 copies.
"The Lonesome Kicker", a Bruce Springsteen-inspired song about the life of a lonely football kicker, was released as the lone single from the album and was accompanied by a music video that got airplay on MTV. This song also partly inspired Sandler's 1998 sports comedy film The Waterboy.
